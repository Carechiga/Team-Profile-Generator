## Description

In order to organize projects and their features its important to assign a Manager, engineers , and interns to facilitate that work is done on time and there is no confusion on who needs to be doing what work.
The Team Profile Generator creates a roster of teammbers with very barebones yet essential information on each team member which makes it easy for communication to get done.
Building a team in this manner allows for a record to be made and eliminate confusion on who is working on certain projects
During the creation of this application, it was necessary for me to master the inquirer node package, and fs write to file. In addition testing using jest to make sure that the classes assigned to employees worked as intended.
